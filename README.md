Why are we solving this problem ??

Emotional reactions have often had an adaptive function in ensuring our existence of the human race. They are either a response to a sensory input or an uninhibited manifestation of an interior cognitive activity. Feelings like dread are frequently a consequence to an environmental stimulation, as when we traverse a main intersection and the terror of being hit by a car activates our adaptive defence instinct. These are the extrinsic factors that set off our sentiments within our intellect. Reactions, on the other hand, can be elicited as a consequence of an inner mental system.
