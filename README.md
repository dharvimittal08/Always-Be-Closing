Why are we solving this problem ??

Emotional reactions have often had an adaptive function in ensuring our existence of the human race. They are either a response to a sensory input or an uninhibited manifestation of an interior cognitive activity. Feelings like dread are frequently a consequence to an environmental stimulation, as when we traverse a main intersection and the terror of being hit by a car activates our adaptive defence instinct. These are the extrinsic factors that set off our sentiments within our intellect. Reactions, on the other hand, can be elicited as a consequence of an inner mental system.

Similarly, we are trying to recreate a similar sensation using the computer's underlying workings. This might be the satisfaction that comes from figuring a mathematical problem, for instance. Moreover, sentiments elicited by environmental stimulation such as excitement, sorrow, astonishment, frustration, dread, and wrath could be simulated via actions such as formal text, electronics, so on and so forth. The analysis and emotional reactions that emerge during social contact would then necessitate the use of technological tools.
